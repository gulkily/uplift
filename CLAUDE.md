# Claude Instructions for Uplift Project

## Commit and Push Workflow
- ALWAYS commit and push changes immediately after completing tasks
- Do NOT ask for confirmation before committing and pushing
- Use descriptive commit messages that explain what was changed
- Push to origin after every commit to keep GitHub Pages updated
- GitHub Pages takes several minutes to update, so immediate pushing is critical

## General Workflow
- Be proactive with git operations
- Complete the full cycle: make changes → commit → push
- Assume the user wants changes deployed unless explicitly told otherwise
