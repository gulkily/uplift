Submissions will be graded on a 1-10 scale in each of the following categories:

Innovation and Originality: The novelty of the solution and its potential to disrupt or significantly improve upon existing services.

Usability and Design: The application's user experience and interface design, ensuring accessibility and ease of use for its intended audience.

Impact Potential: The applicability and scalability of the solution in real-world scenarios, including its potential for adoption and the breadth of its impact on the target market or sector.

Feasibility: The practicality of implementing the solution and the clarity of the implementation plan.

Use of the Blockchain: Effective use of smart contracts on Algorand in the solution, demonstrating an understanding of their benefits and limitations.

(For coding submissions) Technical Implementation: The robustness, security, and efficiency of the applicationâ€™s codebase. Proper use of smart contracts and adherence to best practices in dApp development will be crucial. You must have built your own smart contract on Algorand. Simply copy/pasting from another pre-existing project will not satisfy the criteria.
