**Submission requirements ✅**

**Projects must:**

1. Be built with smart contracts on Algorand 
2. Be open source (and remain available as open source)
3. Include a short summary (<150 chars)
4. Include a full description (the problems it solves, how Algorand was used to achieve it)
5. Include a technical description (what SDKs were used, and what features of Algorand made this uniquely possible)
6. Include a link to the Canva slides used in the presentation (including a slide on your team, problem, solution etc). You must use Canva for your presentation (yes, this is a requirement).
7. (For coding submissions) Have a custom (not boilerplate) smart contract on Algorand. All of this must be fully-functioning, as evidenced in a demo video on your README (see point 8 below).
8. (For coding submissions) Include a clear README on your GitHub repo explaining how your project works. This README must include:
    1. A demo video
    2. Screenshots
    3. A video with audio (e.g. a Loom video [like this](https://youtu.be/ZLKR4zE1o6U?si=6na7139wlVNkmJRa)) explaining how your project works, how the GitHub repo is structured, a demo of everything working etc. This is vital, so that the judges can review your project properly. Make sure you explain clearly how you satisfied point 7 above. This is a great example of a winning Polkadot project’s README: https://github.com/mahir-pa/poap.  Bonus points for if your video is well-edited!

Please make sure you follow the above requirements very carefully.
